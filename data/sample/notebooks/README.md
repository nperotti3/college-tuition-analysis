# Notebooks

This folder contains lightweight example notebooks that replicate a small portion of the full project pipeline.

- `01_explore_tuition_sample.ipynb` — Load sample data, explore trends, plot distributions  
- `02_simple_trend_model.ipynb` — Basic linear model / forecasting demonstration

These notebooks are intentionally simplified for public portfolio use.
